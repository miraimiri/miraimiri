### Hi there, I am Miriam 👋

Nice to meet you. I am a trilingual fullstack web developer 👩🏼‍💻, recently graduated from LeWagon Bootcamp in Tokyo 🇯🇵 (Sep 2020 - March 2021).
Right now I have relocated to Europe (Germany 🇩🇪) and am looking for full-time positions.

<br>

🌱 I'm currently learning a few new frameworks and languages (some Java, some React) to add to my tech stack.

🆙 At the same time, I am upgrading past projects and adding some new frontend elements I have discovered.

📬 You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miriamderenbach/) or email.
